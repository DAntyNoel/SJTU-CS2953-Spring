Lab1 Report

By DAntyNoel

Some problems: It's common to be unfamiliar with such a huge project for the first try.
It takes me a long time to understand the structure of riscv, such as the usage of functions
or params, the api of each programs or files, and so on. 

While it's not difficult to compile 'sleep' program, the others are hard to finish.

I have tried to search for information of fork() and pipe() for 'pingpong'.

As for 'trace' and 'sysinfo', the tutorial pdf is not enough. Firstly I'm not sure with 
modifying the kernal, secondly it's hard to understand the connection between all the files.
So I just search the original lab tutorials on CSDN or other personal website that gives
the full discription of experiment, including scripts and locations, some with common errors,
which benefits my projects a lot.

Another: I haven't got all the points of gdb yet, this tool is hard to use...
