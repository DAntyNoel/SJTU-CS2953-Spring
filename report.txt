The answer for RISCV assembly is store in file `answers-traps.txt`.

Backtrace:

Try to understand when to alarm in function `printf` is a little confused. 
Since the real usage of `PGROUNDDOWN` returns an error location, that needs offset.

Alarm:

The key point of alarm is to safely store the frame. Techniques are to store the whole
trapframe instead of a pointer. (Though it is OK if we store the pointer)

Mistakes met that I can't return a0 correctly. I have tried to call inline assembly
but still be wrong. Notes that a0 is already changed when call the 'sigreturn', the
correct a0 was in trapframe, just return p->trapframe->a0 is OK.
